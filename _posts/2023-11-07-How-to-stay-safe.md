For good reason, injury-prevention should be your first priority before deciding to armwrestle.


As is the case with most sports, noob injuries are not so much due to the inherent risk associated with the activity, but rather, a misunderstanding about how to use one’s body in a safe and effective manner.

There are few activities where this holds more true than in armwrestling.

**The unfortunate truth is that most people don't know how to armwrestle. At all.**

Not only are they moving inefficiently, but their movements are also excellent ways to sustain a rotator cuff injury, increase the potential for neck pain, and even break their arm which, unfortunately, is one of the most common injuries that occur with beginners who don’t understand how to move correctly.


## Don't Push Sideways

All of these injuries can be traced back to the overuse of one simple motion: internal rotation of the shoulder. 

The chances of injury compound when one turns their body AWAY from their hand while continuing to push sideways through internal rotation (as shown below).

*Do NOT turn your body away from your hand like the guy on the left. This is called an “armbreak position"*


Turning your body away from your hand in this manner is a fantastic way to fracture your arm and then claim (incorrectly) that armwrestling is an inherently risky activity that should be avoided altogether.


**The truth is, it’s actually very easy to avoid this “armbreak position” if you practice a few simple safety cues and use a bit of common sense.**

You’ll drastically reduce your chance of any internal rotation or “side pressure” related injury when you follow these tips.

## Simple Cues to Follow

Here's a simple list of cues to follow and internalize whenever you are armwrestling:


**1. Always look at your hand and keep your shoulder in line with your hand when you are moving.** <br>

**2. Bend your wrist and PULL Backwards! Do NOT PUSH sideways!**<br>

**3. Never turn your body away from your hand.**



It's pretty easy to not put yourself in a compromising position if you consciously follow these 3 rules.

## Find a Club

Although the tips and videos above are enough to give you a basic understanding of safety practices, the best way to fully internalize them is during an actual armwrestling setting – NOT in casual matches with your buddies who might also place themselves in compromising positions.

Essentially, what you really need to do is seek out a local armwrestling club in your region where you can apply these lessons and learn from more experienced armwrestlers during regular practice sessions.

Not only will attending regular practices at a club decrease your likelihood of injury, but you will learn how to move in an efficient manner allowing you to generate far more force than if you were just pushing sideways like most people do.

If you don’t know of any clubs in your region, check out [our article]({{site.baseurl }}/aw-clubs-near-me/) on how exactly you can find them.

## One Rule

Hopefully, you better understand how to avoid any “side-pressure” related injuries and can instruct others to follow those 3 practical cues above when you see them getting into compromising positions.

They’re easy to remember and, when implemented, allow you to recruit more of your musculature (rather than just your puny rotator cuff muscles) while also keeping you safe.

And if you want to simplify things further and have one single line, one rule, one maxim that you can bring to the forefront of your mind that encapsulates all of these safety guidelines here it is:

**Bend your wrist, pull backwards, and never turn your body away from your hand.**
