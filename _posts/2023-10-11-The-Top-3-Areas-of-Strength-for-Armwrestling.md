Contrary to its name, armwrestling does not primarily depend on the strength of one's arm.



No doubt the arm – *and even the entire body to a degree* – contributes to the dance that is armwrestling, but professional armwrestlers know that the secret to their success lies elsewhere, and that they must strengthen these other key areas to secure advantages on the table.



##### Those key areas are the hand, wrist, and forearm.

## Which Hand Strengths?

We should be more specific.

Hand strength can manifest in innumerable ways e.g. crushing grip strength, pinching grip strength, hook grip etc., but not all of them are equally important or even applicable for armwrestling. 

So which hand movements are most relevant to the activity?

*Common Grip Variations*

In short, there are three key movements that armwrestlers prioritize above all else. While many argue about the relative importance of these three movements, they are in near-uniform agreement about their primacy regarding armwrestling-specific strengths. These three motions are:

1. **Wrist Flexion**
2. **Pronation**
3. **Radial Deviation**

Let's go into more detail for each of these.


## Wrist Flexion

Wrist flexion or “Cupping” is the act of bending one’s wrist so that the palm faces towards the forearm.

When you hear armwrestlers talking about their Cup, they are primarily referring to wrist flexion, although a degree of finger flexion plays a supporting role due to the fact that we must actually grip our opponent’s hand while armwrestling.

Having a strong Cup allows one to "contain" their opponent's hand, thereby placing them in a defensive position where they have less access to their strength and are forced to recruit fewer muscles in the fight. 

Cupping is present in nearly every technique that you’ll encounter on the armwrestling table, and so, should be heavily focused on in the gym and during table-sparring sessions.

## Pronation

Hold out your hand with your palm facing upward. Now rotate it so that your palm faces downward. 

That's pronation.

In armwrestling, pronation strength is usually expressed in a static manner and the objective is not necessarily to pronate through a large range of motion, but rather, to “maintain one’s pronation” or maintain one’s wrist position anywhere between a neutral-grip to a fully pronated grip (shown below).

*Various grips shown. In armwrestling, pronation usually refers to any position between a neutral pronated grip and a fully pronated grip*


The ability to “maintain our pronation” in an armwrestling match **unlocks the potential for offensive movement** and, through it, access to a huge range of technical ability.

Although we would ideally want to maintain pronation from a neutral grip towards a fully pronated grip, there are defensive situations when our wrist becomes more supinated when we can still utilize pronation strength (though it is less effective than a more pronated position).

One final point to note is that pronation is the mortal enemy of the previous movement: Cup. Pronation and Cup negate each other in an armwrestling setting.

## Radial Deviation

This final movement is one of the most underutilized strengths in armwrestling (even among competitive athletes), but the proper use and development of it can mean the difference between a narrow loss and complete control of your opponent.

I’m referring to the subtle movement called “radial deviation” which occurs when you bend your wrist “upwards” or towards the thumb and the radius bone. 

![rise](/images/radial deviation.png)
*Radial deviation or "Rise"*

The ability to apply radial deviation or “Rise” is one of the deadliest weapons in an armwrestler’s arsenal, and the top pros all recognize its importance within the armwrestling-strengths hierarchy – one of the best armwrestlers on the planet, Devon Larratt, is one of the biggest proponents of having a strong Rise.

The short version of the "why" is that the ability to have a stronger Rise or "Out-Rising" your opponent enables you to dictate the tactical conditions of the match and places your opponent in a “reactive” (rather than active) position with respect to you.

The exact mechanics of why this happens are outside the scope of this article, but just know that your time is well spent training this subtle, but deadly motion.

## Rise, Cup, Roll

And there it is. The top three areas of strength in armwrestling are Wrist Flexion, Pronation, and Radial Deviation.

Rise, Cup, Roll.

For those who are new to the sport, it may come as a surprise that the hand, wrist, and forearm occupy such a prominent position within armwrestling, yet once this knowledge has been internalized it becomes an easier task to focus our training efforts and incorporate the movements which allow us to progress in the specific activity that is armwrestling.
 
While I've provided practical descriptions of each movement here, there are several other things that must be explained in order to have a more complete understanding of how they pertain to armwrestling situations.
