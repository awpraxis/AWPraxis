Welcome to Armwrestling Praxis. 

This page will be dedicated to outlining a series of articles that take a brand-new, never set-their-elbow-on-a-table-before, beginner through the major aspects of organized armwrestling in a sequential manner. 

My goal with this series is to efficiently onboard newcomers who may have only armwrestled in casual settings and/or seen popular clips or videos about armwrestling, but don’t how to get started on their own journey.

If that sounds like you, or you're just a curious person wanting to know more about the world of organized armwrestling, then scroll below and you'll find what you're looking for.


If you prefer a less structured approach then head over to the [Articles]({{site.baseurl }}/blog/) page which contains all posts sorted from most recent to least and dive into whatever catches your eye. 

Either way, this site is set up to encourage free-form exploration and as more articles are published here you’ll find creative ways to navigate through it.


****This page is regularly updated, so check back periodically for new content. Also, articles without links are in the process of being written, revised or published ****
