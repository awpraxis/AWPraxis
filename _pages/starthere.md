# Armwrestling Fundamentals Series

The rest of this page will be dedicated to outlining a series of articles that take a brand-new, never set-their-elbow-on-a-table-before, beginner through the major aspects of organized armwrestling in a sequential manner. 

My intention with this is to efficiently onboard a newcomer who may have only seen popular clips or videos about armwrestling, but doesn't know how or where to get started on the first steps of their journey. 

If that sounds like you, or you're just a curious person wanting to know more about the world of organized armwrestling, then scroll below and you'll find what you're looking for.

****Posts without links are planned articles in the process of being written, revised, or published****
